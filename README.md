# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

# Overview

This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

# Summary

### **Problem Statement**

The dataset describes about the marketing campagins for a bank, which consists of the information about :-

- Bank client data (**attributes** :- age, job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, balance)
- The last contact of the current campaign (**attributes** :- contact, month, day, duration)
- Other (**attributes** :- campaign, Pdays, previous, poutcome)
  - **y** is the desired target, where we need to know whether client subscribed the term deposit or not (**yes** or **no**) . The dataset contains 32950 training data in CSV file and its a classification problem.

### **Solution for the problem statement**

The above figure describes how to perform the problem statement in an effective way, there are two ways of approaching the problem:-

- To optimize the hyper parameter of custom coded model using a tool called **HyperDrive**. HyperDrive will help us to find the best parameter to the model compared to manual Hyperparameter tuning.
- **AutoML** which helps us to choose the best algorithm, which evaluates the different pipelines on its own and help us to find the best optimal solution in a faster way.

# Scikit-learn Pipeline

### Pipeline architecture including data

- train.python scripts

### Algorithm

- Logistic Regression is a binary classification algorithm in which dependent variable is binary i,e
  1(True,Sucess),0(False,Failure). Goal is to find the best fitting model for independent and dependent variable in the relationship. Independent variable can be continous or binary, also called as **logit regression**, used in machine learning,deals with probability to measure the relation between dependent and independent variables.

### benefits of the parameter sampler

### benefits of the early stopping policy

# AutoML

**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison

**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work

**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
